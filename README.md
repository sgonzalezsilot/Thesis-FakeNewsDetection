# My Thesis - fIlfA: Fake News Detection using BERT, Transformers and NLP
Repository of the Scientific Analysis and Web App of the Final Degree Project of **Santiago Gonz√°lez Silot**.

The Fine-Tuning.ipynb file contains the analysis of the 2 *datasets* together with the different tests carried out in the work.
The rest of the files correspond to the web app of the work.

* An analysis of the main datasets available for the detection of fake news has been carried out. 
* Comparison between 7 BERT and RoBERTa models (4 for English and 3 for Spanish) with 4 different optimization and regularization techniques specialized for word embeddings. Giving a total of 28 different models tested.
* Results very close to the winners of the Iberlef and ConstraintAAAI competitions were obtained using a considerably simpler model.
* Implementation of a basic web interface for the use and access to the models. Currently it can be accessed through HuggingFace:
